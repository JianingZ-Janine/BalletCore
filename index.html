          <p>Starting ballet doesn’t mean you need to buy a full wardrobe of leotards, skirts, and pointe shoes right
            away.
            In
            fact, all you need to begin is a comfortable outfit you can move in — and a pair of soft ballet shoes.
            That’s
            more
            than enough for your first class and to feel the joy of movement at the barre.

            When you're ready to explore more, Edinburgh has a lovely selection of local ballet shops offering
            everything
            from
            elegant wrap skirts and leotards to warm-up gear and pointe shoes. Whether you're just starting out or
            building
            your
            dream ballet wardrobe, this guide will show you where to find quality dancewear and friendly expert advice —
            without
            the pressure to buy everything at once.
